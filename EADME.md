DETAILS:
• Innovative, hands-on team player and leader who leverages a valuable blend of interpersonal and technical skills to drive engineering efficiency and productivity.
• Has over 30 years of experience in control system design and building/facilities design including management, engineering, financial, and supervisory duties, as well as hands on design.
• Project management includes feasibility studies, cost estimates, cost-benefit analysis, (including payback and ROI), specification writing, project preparation, competitive bidding, OEM selection, supervision, and coordination, design approval, timeline management, scope management, quality management, resource management, and cost management, risk control, machine runoff, installation, debugging, operator and maintenance training, and billing verification.
• Personnel Management includes the coaching, mentoring, development, training and supervision of engineers and skilled tradesmen within a union shop plant as well as direct supervision, employee and team motivation, candidate evaluation, hiring recommendation, performance review, conflict resolution, and union grievance resolution.
• Control System Design includes hardware designing, material requisition, software programming, build supervision, installation, startup, and debugging.
• Architectural/Facilities including power, lighting, fire protection, communications networks, energy management systems, and HVAC.
• Testing and Validation includes infotainment systems and diesel locomotive engine control.
 MANAGEMENT
• Directed the efforts of 6 engineers, 14 electricians, and 2 millwrights in a union shop environment at Ford Motor Company.
• Established plant electrical standards and collaborated with plant safety and corporate standards groups at Ford Motor Company to ensure the quality of controls systems used on new tools, machinery, and systems.
• Managed the installation of a conveyor system commissioned at GM Janesville two months ahead of schedule and $80,000 under budget while achieving zero personnel injuries, safety infractions, or work slowdowns.  Successfully managed projects up to $5.5M.
• Performed a feasibility study for GM Metal Fabricating Division and determined that a machine vision system could not replace an expensive, trouble-prone part-positioning system, saving the company from spending $20,000 on a system incapable of functioning in the production environment.
ENGINEERING
• Developed a simple control system for an automatic tool changer for Valeo that incorporated energy-saving design and extensive diagnostics, including cycle-time totalizers, which provided user-screen prompting when periodic and preventive maintenance was required.
• Devised a simplified control scheme for a particular filtration system that allowed it to be implemented in an SLC-5-04 PLC rather than the more expensive PLC-5-20 previously used.
• Rewrote programs in Microsoft Basic to make several gauging stations at two Allied Signal plants Y2K compliant, eliminating the need for a company to spend $20,000 to replace the stations.
• Provided in-plant support of 1 large material handling system, one class A and one class G paint finishing system, 63 injection-molding machines, and 16 large blow molding machines.
• Did the last large substation/bus duct upgrade at a Ford parts plant entirely in-house without the aid of outside consultants. Project consisted of a medium-voltage substation, two 5,200-volt substations, several 5,200-volt motor controllers and several 480-volt substations and over 2000 feet of bus duct. Project was completed on time and within budget.
• Added a safety pendant to several existing milling machines at Ford Batavia for automatic transmission valve bodies, allowing setup personnel to enter the machine’s work area to make adjustments without risk of injury.
